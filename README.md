=========

We study computer science for fun and ???. Then we post our secret findings here. TOP SECRET DO NOT ENTER!

### Schedules

The [classic Friday night meetings](https://github.com/CompSciCabal/reading-material). We're currently reading CS papers for a few months before picking our next book.

We're also [reading SICP again](https://www.meetup.com/SICP-TO/), because it was so much fun the first time! (And the second time, and the third time!)

### Also

We have a [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cs-cabal) and a [google plus](https://plus.google.com/communities/101341712823792967748) and a [twitterer](https://twitter.com/cscabal)
and a [Code of Conduct](https://bentomiso.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201812303-Code-of-Conduct) and even a slack team. Come and join us if you like theory and practice and fun and dinosaurs!
