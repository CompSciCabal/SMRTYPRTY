3.2.3
-----

In figure 3.10 they show two different procedure objects returned from the
same procedure pointing to the same "memory location" for the body of the code. That's pretty interesting, as as the reading group meeting the other night we investigated whether two different procedures with the same logic have identical pointers, using a point-eq function, and the answer seemed to be
'No'.
